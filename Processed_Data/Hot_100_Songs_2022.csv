[Verse 1]
Usually, I put somethin' on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today, I see our reflections clearly
In Hollywood, layin' on the screen
You just need a better life than this
You need somethin' I can never give

Come on, Harry, we wanna say goodnight to you

[Verse 1]
Holdin' me back
Gravity's holdin' me back
I want you to hold out the palm of your hand
Why don't we leave it at that?
Nothin' to say
When everything gets in the way
Seems you cannot be replaced
And I'm the one who will stay, oh-oh-oh

In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was

You know it's not the same

[Verse 2]
Answer the phone
""Harry, you're no good alone
Why are you sitting at home on the floor?
What kind of pills are you on?""
Ringin' the bell
And nobody's coming to help
Your daddy lives by himself
He just wants to know that you're well, oh-oh-oh

But I'm pretty sure our time is up (Now your time is up)
And so we fell off the spinning tops

Always left Abuela and the family fumbling

You found a new girl and it only took a couple weeks
Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world?

And good for you, I guess that you've been workin' on yourself
I guess that therapist I found for you, she really helped
Now you can be a better man for your brand-new girl (Girl)

Well, good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doin' great out there without me, baby
God, I wish that I could do that
I've lost my mind, I've spent the night
Cryin' on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you

Well, good for you, I guess you're gettin' everything you want (Ah)
You bought a new car and your career's really takin' off (Ah)
It's like we never even happened
Baby, what the fuck is up with that? (Ah)
And good for you, it's like you never even met me

I don't feel a single thing
Have the pills done too much?
Haven't caught up with my friends in weeks
And now we're outta touch

And the world, it feels too big
Like a floating ball that's bound to break
Snap my psyche like a twig

And I just wanna see
If you feel the same as me

Like you're not really happy but you don't wanna die
Like you're hangin' by a thread but you gotta survive
'Cause you gotta survive
Like your body's in the room but you're not really there
Like you have empathy inside but you don't really care
Like you're fresh outta love but it's been in the air
Am I past repair?

A little bit tired of trying to care when I don't

I be in the loop, she be in a group (Yeah)
Brodie want her friend, throw 'em alley-oop (Yeah)
Turned somethin' to nothin', bruh, I'm livin' proof
How can I lose when we the who's who's?
Still runnin' 'round with Mohawk, jet ready, pack the Goyard
People probably think I show off, I ain't even give it yet
Runnin' up a silly check, stayin' off the internet
Share the stage with Billie Eilish, turnt at any given time
Personal partners pillow talkin' 'cause I got rich without 'em
Only thing they should be sayin' is, ""Baby keep it solid""
We ain't even deep as we used to be, this shit slick, divided
Bruh ain't got no hustle or nothin', so he gon' stick to violence
I be known to run down, I'm dialed in, so I can't speak about it
She know I'm a gangster, she love me, I bring the freak up out her
Can't play with me, you know I come trim, I'm in a different league
I'm tired of showin' what I can get done, what you gon' do for me?
Forty-thousand miles up in the air, only time I get some Z's
Full-court press, foot on they neck, and I can't let 'em breathe
Blood, sweat, and tears come with this check, it ain't nowhere near easy
Had to fall back, you know how that go, we only speakin' briefly
Hope I'm not too much to handle, city nigga from Atlanta
I spent my last check on ammo, this is not a regular Lambo
Hundred thousand dollars kit, could've put down on another Lambo
Don't be in the mix, I built this shit forever havin' say so
This shit gon' get serious about my money, this ain't no fuckin' Play-Doh
Brodie down for double homicide, I try to tell him, ""Lay low""
C don't like to drive, but he spin good, I'm on the way to Clayco

I'm just tryna ball and live, hundred mill', I'm calling dibs
I'm the boss, pay all the bills, I'm the golden child for real
Go off in this bitch, I will, I been on my grind for years
And I'm out here grinding still, I need equity to sign the deal
I'm just tryna ball and live, hundred mill', I'm calling dibs
I'm the boss, pay all the bills, I'm the golden child for real
Go off in this bitch, I will, I been on my grind for years
And I'm out here grinding still, I need equity to sign the deal

[Verse 2]
Overbuying cars, I snatch the Brabus just for motivation
Shootout at the spot today, tomorrow, we in a new location
Free all of the guys, I hope y'all beat the case or get probation
Stash it at my mama house, four hundred bands in the ventilation
Now look how I'm living, I bought a house for the money to stay at
Right when niggas think that I got soft, I'ma pull up and spray at
Living like a don, might smoke a blunt in the back of the Maybach
Pull up like your mama with the switch, ""Why the fuck would you say that?”
You can do it first, I'ma do it worst, gotta double the pay back Never take it personal, show no mercy, bruh taught me that way back
Condo to get off, I was always taught, ""Don't tell hoes where you stay at""
Keep a stash house, you can't take nothing to the spot where you lay at
Never be a bother, if you off me, no problem, just say that
Never runnin' off, so if I owe you, I got you, I'll pay that
Give this shit my all, so when I'm old, I can chill and just lay back
Really from the bottom so the trenches is where I feel safe at
[Chorus]
I'm just tryna ball and live, hundred mill', I'm calling dibs
I'm the boss, pay all the bills, I'm the golden child for real
Go off in this bitch, I will, I been on my grind for years
And I'm out here grinding still, I need equity to sign the deal
I'm just tryna ball and live, hundred mill', I'm calling dibs
I'm the boss, pay all the bills, I'm the golden child for real

(Heads Carolina, tails California)

[Verse 1]
I was out with the boys, catchin' up in a neon light
Didn't know 'til we walked in it was karaoke night
She was in a circle of girls, chasin' a shot with a lime
She was laughin', they were darin' her to get on the mic
One of 'em walked up and turned in her name
Next thing I knew, man, she was up on the stage, singin'

[Chorus]
""Heads Carolina, tails California""
Maybe she'd fall for a boy from South Georgia
She's got the bar in the palm of her hand
And she's a '90s country fan like I am
Hey, I got a Chevy, she can flip a quarter
I'd drive hеr anywhere from herе to California
When this song is over, I gotta find her
'Cause she had me at ""Heads Carolina""

[Verse 2]
Yeah, she knew every word by heart, didn't need no screen, no
I was raisin' my glass up for her, I saw her smilin' at me, yeah
She had me down in the front by the end of verse two

Few days before he turned 80
He was sitting out back in a rocker
He said ""What you been up to lately?""
I told him chasing a dollar
And in between sips of coffee
He poured this wisdom out
Said ""If you want my two cents on making a dollar count

[Chorus: Jordan Davis]
Buy dirt
Find the one you can't live without
Get a ring, let your knee hit the ground
Do what you love but call it work
And throw a little money in the plate at church
Send your prayers up and your roots down deep
Add a few limbs to your family tree
And watch their pencils marks, and the grass in the yard
All grow up
'Cause the truth about it is it all goes by real quick
You can't buy happiness
But you can buy dirt""

I'm the strong one, I'm not nervous
I'm as tough as the crust of the Earth is
I move mountains, I move churches
And I glow, 'cause I know what my worth is
I don't ask how hard the work is
Got a rough, indestructible surface
Diamonds and platinum, I find 'em, I flatten 'em
I take what I'm handed, I break what's demanded, but

[Verse 1]
Under the surface
I feel berserk as a tightrope walker in a three-ring circus
Under the surface
Was Hercules ever like, ""Yo, I don't wanna fight Cerberus?""
Under the surface
I'm pretty surе I'm worthless if I can't be of servicе

[Pre-Chorus]
A flaw or a crack, the straw in the stack
That breaks the camel's back
What breaks the camel's back, it's

[Chorus]
Pressure like a drip, drip, drip that'll never stop, whoa
Pressure that'll tip, tip, tip 'til you just go pop, whoa-oh-oh
Give it to your sister, your sister's older
Give her all the heavy things we can't shoulder
Who am I if I can't run with the ball?
If I fall to
Pressure like a grip, grip, grip, and it won't let go, whoa
Pressure like a tick, tick, tick 'til it's ready to blow, whoa-oh-oh
Give it to your sister, your sister's stronger
See if she can hang on a little longer
Who am I if I can't carry it all?
If I falter

Under the surface
I hide my nerves and it worsens, I worry somethin' is gonna hurt us
Under the surface
The ship doesn't swerve, has it heard how big the iceberg is?
Under the surface
I think about my purpose, can I somehow preserve this?
Line up the dominoes, a light wind blows
You try to stop it tumbling, but on and on it goes

[Bridge]
But wait, if I could shake the crushing weight of expectations
Would that free some room up for joy
Or relaxation, or simple pleasure?
Instead, we measure this growing pressure
Keeps growing, keep going, 'cause all we know is

[Chorus]
Pressure like a drip, drip, drip that'll never stop, whoa
Pressure that'll tip, tip, tip 'til you just go pop, whoa-oh-oh
Give it to your sister, it doesn't hurt and
See if she can handle every family burden
Watch as she buckles and bends but never breaks
No mistakes, just
Pressure like a grip, grip, grip, and it won't let go, whoa
Pressure like a tick, tick, tick 'til it's ready to blow, whoa-oh-oh
Give it to your sister and never wonder
If the same pressure would've pulled you under
Who am I if I don't have what it takes?
No cracks, no breaks
No mistakes, no pressure!40Embed"

Heard you moved out to South Carolina

Packed your bags in that old 4Runner
That I bought you when things were good
I'm glad to see the stop sign didn't hit ya
Bring you back to your senses
Oh, it waved you gone, goodbye
Yeah, it waved you gone, goodbye

I heard you found yourself a brand-new man
Put a rock on your finger and he vowed you a second chance
Built a house right by the coast
That ocean view is beautiful, but baby, I just want you to know
He don't know you like I did
Money talks, but I ain't buyin'

And my sons out of jail (Sons out of jail)

Siento que puedo volar

Someone asked me once in an interview
""What was growing up like?""
""Where'd you go to school?""
""And what would you do if you weren't doin' this?""
I'd be drivin' my first car, an old worn-out Dodge
Tryin' to make rent with a dead-end job, just makin' due
With tips in a jar, my guitar, and an old barstool

[Chorus]
I'd have a Friday night crowd in the palm of my hand
Cup of brown liquor, couple buddies in a band
Singin' them same damn songs like I am now
I'd be feelin' on fire on a hardwood stage
Bright lights like lightning runnin' through my veins
At the Grand Ole Opry or a show in some no-name town
I'd still be doin' this if I weren't doin' this

[Verse 2]
I'd still be the same guy they knew back in the day
Who was burnin' CD's just to give away
Payin' his dues
If I wasn't doin' this
Five deep in a van, head full of steam
Hot on the heels of my neon dreams maybe comin' true

Бэнгер
А, да , я собираюсь сделать бэнгер из этого

[Припев: Лил Дёрк]
В прошлый раз ты сказал мне, что гордишься мной
Ты не гордился, ты был из ниггеров, что сомневались во мне
Я был слишком зол на тебя, ты позволил им убить себя
Ты мой брат, это трагедия
Удивительно, но мне пришла идея
Я так устал от постоянных вопросов от ниггеров:
""Кто был убийцей под капюшоном?""
Бро я король, значит у нас все хорошо (ДиДжей на бите, и это бэнгер)

[Куплет 1: Лил Дёрк]
Рассказываю дяде о своих проблемах
Научился выживать, ношу с собой пистолет
Ещё до двеннадцати я пошел к врачу
Трахнул стриптезершу, взял к себе Рокси
Как тебе моя кровь, и ты пиздел что трахнешь меня?
Будь верен мне, не думая о шалавах
Не говори мое имя если говоришь о этих телах
Не говори мое имя если говоришь о этих телах
""Прекрати укуриваться после того как дропаешь""
Как ты смеешь винить меня? Вы все дали ему убежище
Сука, я звезда, мне нужен презерватив
Не пью Пар, только Воку
Сиппую воку, ощущаю себя Флокой
Дерьмо в моем кармане, оно пойдет на район
Скажи что я имею в виду, что ты имеешь в виду? Я поймал тебя
Убирайся от нее, быстрее, не дергайся
Назвал тебя сукой, мне жаль, я потерял тебя
Голова вниз, таблетка Икс, Перкоцет, прекрати это
Сука мой телефон сдох, дай мне зарядку
Нету пальто, ходил в школу в термокостюме
Шлюхи на которых ты равняешься погубят тебя
Съеби с моего бизнеса, это мимо тебя
Начинаю копать под это дерьмо,как только узнаю тебя
Я люблю эти траншеи, это навсегда
О боже, что стряслось с Вирджилом?
Я так бы хотел чтобы мой брат выжил после операции
Я не сплю, думаю, это из-за этого
Как только они поймают, так сразу убьют меня (О нет, о)
Дал брату двадцатку, он вызвал взломщиков
Люблю шалав которые говорят что не навредят мне
Никогда не видил кровь, это дерьмо станет бордовым

Свеж, как первый школьный день, я ученый
Найдя решение получил еще больше проблем
Мы из песочницы, мой кореш со мной с младенчества
Было шестнадцать, первый сбыт оружия
Вылет из Ван-Найса, прилет в Ока-Лока
Харош летать на Джи5, летай на вертолетах (летай на вертолетах)
Считаю каждое благословение, каждый доллар
Собираюсь идти на фабрику
Одинаково отношусь ко всем своим корешам
Одинаково забочусь о своих шалавах
Я надеюсь, ты финансово вменяем
Никогда не отвернусь от банды
Нас учили быть храбрыми
Поссорились, залегли на дно
Оставайся сильным, ты все переживешь
Это мой ниггер, что стряслось с Вирджилом?
Беседовал с Богом, не хочу быть трупом
У меня есть стиль, хер знает о чем вы слышали
You lil' pussy, you soft and fertile
Вокруг меня только проверенные
Вокруг меня только проверенные, оу
Покойся с миром Принс, брызну фиолетового

Держи себя в руках, делай это не безцельно

The trouble with a heartbreak (Heartbreak)

[Verse 1]
Don't let anybody tell ya it's gonna be easy ('Cause it ain't easy)
Don't let anyone tell ya they know what it's like
Mmh, when they say
""Get out on this town, meet somebody new, get lost in the crowd"" all I see is you
Don't let anybody tell ya it's gonna be easy

[Chorus]
And that's the trouble with a heartbreak, it's gonna hang around
Leave you midnight breakin' down, wonderin' how
Long that it's gonna take gettin' over her
It's a can't drown whiskey down kinda hurt
Yeah, you can burn thеm four wheels up that road
But there ain't nowherе her memory can go
That's the trouble with a heartbreak
Yeah, that's the trouble with a heartbreak, a heartbreak, yeah
(Heartbreak, heartbreak, heartbreak)

Nobody In His Right Mind Would've Left Her
That was her favorite song
She sang along every time it came on
The first time we danced was to Marina Del Rey
And I fell right there and then
I didn't want that song to end
Baby Blue was the color of her eyes
I can still see them in my mind
Probably will for the rest of my life

[Chorus]
Damn strait, you're killing me, man
You know I've always been your biggest fan
Now I can't even listen
'Cause I'll get to missin' her
Then the hurt gets worse
Damn strait, I used to love your songs
But now every time that one comes on
My heart gets broke in half
But do I wish I could get her back?
Damn straight

[Verse 2]
The other day right out of the Blue Clear Sky
You came on in my truck
I couldn't turn it off fast enough
I tried to get back in the game
But this ole heart just ain't the same

Say, ""It's not that hard""
But I just got a feeling
This will leave an ugly scar

Yeah, this could be your last drink from a stranger in a bar
The last time that you're dancing in unfamiliar arms
Yeah, this could be your last first kiss, if we do this thing right
Your last time alone beneath neon lights

[Chorus]
It could be your last night coming in here, drinking all by yourself
The last time giving your heart away to someone else
Yeah, we could be some history in the making girl, tonight
Might be your last night lonely

[Verse 2]
Yeah, you could be the last first name that's ever been worth asking
Yeah, you could be the last phone number I write down on a napkin
Yeah, you could be the last girl that I take back home to Mama
The last time that we're talked about in this small-town drama

[Chorus]
It's gonna be the last night coming in here, drinking all by yourself
The last time giving your heart away to someone else
Yeah, we could be some history in the making girl, tonight
Might be your last night lonely
It could be your last night lonely

[Verse 3]
It could be your last night coming in here, drinking all by yourself
The last time giving your heart away to someone else
Yeah, we could be some history in the making girl, tonight

You and I
Had this off and on so long
You've been here, then you've been gone
So many times
And every night
Yeah, I'm always bumpin' into you
We do the same things we used to
It's your place or it's mine, so

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Well, I swear we're through with the lonely drunk and déjà vu
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Five minutes out of downtown
Ain't nothin' but a countdown

[Chorus]
One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three shots of whiskey
Are you on your way?
Way tipsy, baby, come kiss me, I can't wait, I can't wait
Mississippi, two Mississippi, three in the mornin'
We'll be on our way
So tipsy, can't stop kissin', I can't wait, I can't wait forever

[Verse 2]
Mm, every time I'm at this bar, tap on the shoulder, turn around
And baby, there you are

I swear I don't know how I trusted
A Montero with the AC busted
A couple bad demos on a burned CD
Would take me all the way to Tennessee
I showed up to the new apartment
First month's, last month's, two deposits
Hadn't heard the sound of a door slam yet
Thank God I was an optimist

[Chorus]
I drove circles around this town
Tryna write circles around this town
Tryin' to say somethin' with meanin'
Somethin' worth singin' about
I've been kind and I've been ruthless
Yeah, I got here, but the truth is
Thought when I hit it, it'd all look different
But I still got the pedal down
Drivin' circles around this town

[Verse 2]
So many times, I thought about lеavin'
Got my ass kicked tryin' to compete with
Evеrybody else's ones that got away
Hung around long enough to catch a break
A couple hundred songs and the ones that finally worked
Was the one about a car and the one about a church
That I wrote
